    "Queues are abstract Datatypes and they are collection of elements\n",
    "Stacks work on FIFO principle - First In First out <br>\n",
    "Queues are usually implemented using Arrays. They can be implemented using Pointers too.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of Basic Queues\n",
    "1. Single-Ended Queue: In this Queue, elements are added from one end (called Head/Left) and removed from another end(called Tail/Right)<br>\n",
    "2. Double-Ended Queue: In this Queue, elements are added from either left or right end and similarly they can be removed from either end:\n",
    "\n",
    "Other advanced implementations are:\n",
    "3. Priority Queues: This are similar to basic queues except that the elements will have priorities assigned to them. Higher priority elements will be retrieved first before lower priority element.<br>\n",
    "4. Circular Queues: This are queues with fixed size. old elements are removed/replaced as new elements come in\n",

    "- `IsEmpty`: Check to see if the Queue is empty.\n",
